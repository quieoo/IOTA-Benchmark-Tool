# IOTA-Benchmark-Tool

A benchmark tool for IOTA blockchain. The automatic transaction initiator is implemented with multi-threading NodeJS, utilizing APIs provided by IOTA foundation. Each initiator will automatically send transactions with pre-configured sender’s seed and receiver’s address in ***config.json***.

The monitor is implemented with Golang for high performance.

Utilizing these tools, you can exhibit some unique characteristics of IOTA from several aspects such as performance, security, etc.
